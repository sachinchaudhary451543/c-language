/*
self-calling:  a function that calls itself to solve sub-problems. 
base case: Essential to stop recursion and prevent infinite loops. 
recursive case: the condition under which the function keeps calling itself. 
stack usage: consumes stack space with each call, risk of overflow. 
applications: ideal for divisible tasks,tree/graph traversals,sorting algorithms. 
memory intensive: more overhead than iterative solutions. 
clarity: often simplifies complex problems.
