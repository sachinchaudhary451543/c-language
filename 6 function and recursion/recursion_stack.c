/*
memory allocation: recursive calls add frames to the call stack for variables and return points. 
growth with depth: deeper recursion equals more stack space. 
base case: essential to limit resursion depth and prevent stack overflow. 
stack overflow risk: excesive recursion depth can crash the program. 
tail recursion optimization: can reduce stack usage for certain recursive patterns.asm
efficiency: iterative solutions may be more stack-efficient than recursion for some problems.
